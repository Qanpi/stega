Putting hidden messages into images (memes) with python. Inspired by Computerphile.
The project is open-source and free to use for anyone and everyone.

The code uses numpy as a foundation for all image processing and cv2 for reading and writing image files. 
It contains several main functions for the user to interact with. These functions are optimized pretty well 
for usage on large chunks of data, but may contain bugs/unexpected behaviour. Please, do not use this code
for anything requiring reliability or accuracy. 

Suggestions about code improvement are always appreciated.
