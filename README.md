Putting hidden messages into images (memes) with python. Inspired by Computerphile.
The project is open-source and free to use for anyone and everyone.

The code uses numpy and cv2 as a foundation. It contains four main functions for the user to interact with. 
These functions are optimized pretty well for usage on large chunks of data, but may contain bugs/unexpected behaviour.
Suggestions about code improvement are always appreciated.
